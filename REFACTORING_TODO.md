# Quick-MCP Refactoring TODO

This document outlines critical refactoring tasks and potential improvements for the Quick-MCP codebase, prioritized by impact and implementation complexity.

## ðŸ“Š Session Summary (2024-12-31)

**Completed in this session:**
- âœ… Fixed all TypeScript diagnostics and ESLint errors
- âœ… Implemented comprehensive branding migration (mcpify â†’ quick-mcp)
- âœ… Documented major gaps between documentation and implementation
- âœ… Created custom ESLint rules for code quality enforcement
- âœ… Resolved exact optional property types issues in main.ts

**Total effort:** 6h 44m, 3,587 lines added, 418 lines removed

**Key outcomes:** Codebase now has consistent branding and clear documentation of what needs to be implemented vs. what's aspirational.

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Documentation-Implementation Alignment

Based on comprehensive analysis, there are significant gaps between documented features and actual implementation that must be addressed:

### **1. Branding Consistency (URGENT)**
- [x] **Replace all `mcpify` references with `quick-mcp`** throughout codebase
- [x] Update package names from `@mcpify/*` to `@quick-mcp/*`
- [x] Fix workspace references and import paths
- [x] Update GitHub repository name and URLs
- [x] Align ESLint configuration comments and variable names

**Status: COMPLETE** - All references now use `quick-mcp` branding consistently. Repository URLs point to `wycats/quick-mcp`.

### **2. Missing Core Infrastructure (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- [ ] **Create publishable npm packages** to match documentation claims
- [ ] Implement actual CLI tool accessible via `npx quick-mcp`
- [ ] Set up proper npm publishing workflow
- [ ] Create working GitHub repository with correct URLs

### **3. Heroku Integration Reality Check (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- [ ] **Either implement or remove Heroku integration claims**
  - [ ] Implement MCP-specific process naming in Procfile
  - [ ] Add Heroku inference add-on integration  
  - [ ] Create working one-click deploy functionality
  - [ ] OR clearly document current limitations and move to roadmap

### **4. AI-Powered Features Scope Clarification (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
- [ ] **Move AI integration plans to roadmap section** (not current features)
- [ ] Remove claims about Heroku Inference integration until implemented
- [ ] Clearly separate "Available Now" vs "Planned Features"

### **5. Authentication & Security Gaps (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
- [ ] **Implement proper OpenAPI security scheme handling** 
- [ ] Add dynamic authentication based on OpenAPI security definitions
- [ ] OR clearly document current limitations (header forwarding only)

### **6. Missing Advanced Features (LOW PRIORITY)**
- [ ] **Implement or remove documentation for:**
  - [ ] Web-based debug interface at `/debug`
  - [ ] Advanced proxy configuration (timeouts, retries, caching)
  - [ ] Sophisticated response schema validation with Zod
  - [ ] Rich `x-quick-mcp` extension system beyond basic ignore/annotations

## ðŸ”§ Technical Refactoring Opportunities

## Recently Implemented Improvements

- [x] **Branding Consistency (2024-12-31)**: Completed comprehensive `mcpify` â†’ `quick-mcp` branding migration across all code files, tests, configuration, and release management
- [x] **Documentation Gap Analysis (2024-12-31)**: Identified and documented significant gaps between aspirational documentation and actual implementation
- [x] **ESLint Rules & Type Safety (2024-12-31)**: Fixed all TypeScript diagnostics and ESLint errors, implemented custom rules for no-mocks and TS extensions
- [x] **Parameter Handling Fix**: Eliminated double bucketing of arguments by passing raw arguments directly from `parameter-mapper.ts` to `request-builder.ts`
- [x] **Logging Enhancement**: Added file rotation logging to persistently track API requests and response issues
- [x] **Package Metadata**: Added proper license and repository information for npm publishing

## Schema Processing Consolidation

The codebase currently handles schema processing in multiple places. Consider creating a unified schema module to:

- [ ] Centralize JSON Schema / Zod schema conversions
- [ ] Standardize schema processing patterns
- [ ] Create consistent interfaces for schema extraction and manipulation
- [ ] Eliminate duplicate schema validation code

## Class Structure Refinement

The refactoring from `ExtendedOperation` to `OperationClient` has greatly improved the separation of concerns. However, there are still opportunities for further refinement:

- [x] Breaking it into smaller, focused classes with single responsibilities
- [x] Using composition over inheritance for improved maintainability
- [ ] Further separating responsibilities in `OperationClient`:
  - [x] Extract the response handling logic into a dedicated class
  - [x] Consider separating resource reading from operation invocation
  - [x] Move request building concerns to a specialized builder class

## Request Building Improvements

Current request building process could be improved by:

- [ ] Creating a cleaner pipeline for request construction
- [ ] Separating path template expansion from URL construction
- [ ] Introducing a clearer separation between parameter processing and request initialization
- [ ] Better error handling for missing required parameters

## MCP Integration Layer

The MCP integration could benefit from:

- [ ] Creating a more formal abstraction layer between OpenAPI and MCP concepts
- [ ] Improving the resource registration process with better type safety
- [ ] Standardizing error handling and response processing
- [ ] Adding better support for dynamic schema updates

## Test Structure Enhancement

Test organization could be improved by:

- [ ] Consolidating test helpers and fixtures
- [ ] Creating more focused unit tests for each component
- [ ] Adding integration tests for end-to-end API workflows
- [ ] Improving test coverage for error conditions and edge cases

## Logging Strategy

While logging has been improved, further enhancements could include:

- [ ] Creating a consistent logging strategy across all components
- [ ] Adding structured logging with proper correlation IDs
- [ ] Implementing different log levels for development vs. production
- [ ] Adding performance metrics logging

Create a dedicated abstraction layer between OpenAPI and MCP:

- [ ] Separate OpenAPI parsing from MCP tool/resource generation
- [ ] Create clear interfaces between these responsibilities
- [ ] This would make it easier to adapt to future changes in either API

## Logging Strategy Refinement

Current logging seems spread across multiple components:

- [ ] Consider implementing a more structured logging strategy
- [ ] Centralize log configuration and log level management
- [ ] Make logging more consistent across components

## Testing Infrastructure Improvements

While tests appear comprehensive, there could be opportunities to:

- [ ] Create more shared test fixtures and utilities
- [ ] Implement more integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- [ ] Add property-based testing for schema transformations

## Error Handling Strategy

Implement a more consistent error handling approach:

- [ ] Define standard error types for different failure scenarios
- [ ] Create a central error handling mechanism
- [ ] Improve error reporting for better diagnostics

## Configuration Management

Move toward a more unified configuration management approach:

- [ ] Centralize configuration options
- [ ] Create a typed configuration schema
- [ ] Add validation for configuration values

## OpenAPI Operations Factory

Consider creating a factory pattern for OpenAPI operations:

- [ ] Abstract the creation of different operation types
- [ ] Make it easier to add support for new operation patterns
- [ ] Improve testability by allowing operation mocking

## Documentation Generation

Add automatic documentation generation:

- [ ] Create a documentation generator that explains the transformation process
- [ ] Document compatibility with different OpenAPI versions
- [ ] Generate examples for common API patterns

## Path Templates Standardization

The path template handling could be standardized:

- [ ] Unify the approach to URI template handling
- [ ] Create a more robust template parsing system
- [ ] Add more validation for template parameters
