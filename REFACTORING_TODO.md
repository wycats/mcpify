# MCPify Refactoring Ideas

This document outlines potential refactoring opportunities to improve the MCPify codebase, based on lessons learned during development and debugging.

## Recently Implemented Improvements

- [x] **Parameter Handling Fix**: Eliminated double bucketing of arguments by passing raw arguments directly from `parameter-mapper.ts` to `request-builder.ts`
- [x] **Logging Enhancement**: Added file rotation logging to persistently track API requests and response issues
- [x] **Package Metadata**: Added proper license and repository information for npm publishing

## Schema Processing Consolidation

The codebase currently handles schema processing in multiple places. Consider creating a unified schema module to:

- [ ] Centralize JSON Schema / Zod schema conversions
- [ ] Standardize schema processing patterns
- [ ] Create consistent interfaces for schema extraction and manipulation
- [ ] Eliminate duplicate schema validation code

## Class Structure Refinement

The `ExtendedOperation` class has grown quite large with many responsibilities. Consider:

- [ ] Breaking it into smaller, focused classes with single responsibilities
- [ ] Using composition over inheritance for improved maintainability
- [ ] Creating separate handlers for parameters, responses, and requests
- [ ] Extracting the parameter handling logic into a dedicated class

## Request Building Improvements

Current request building process could be improved by:

- [ ] Creating a cleaner pipeline for request construction
- [ ] Separating path template expansion from URL construction
- [ ] Introducing a clearer separation between parameter processing and request initialization
- [ ] Better error handling for missing required parameters

## MCP Integration Layer

The MCP integration could benefit from:

- [ ] Creating a more formal abstraction layer between OpenAPI and MCP concepts
- [ ] Improving the resource registration process with better type safety
- [ ] Standardizing error handling and response processing
- [ ] Adding better support for dynamic schema updates

## Test Structure Enhancement

Test organization could be improved by:

- [ ] Consolidating test helpers and fixtures
- [ ] Creating more focused unit tests for each component
- [ ] Adding integration tests for end-to-end API workflows
- [ ] Improving test coverage for error conditions and edge cases

## Logging Strategy

While logging has been improved, further enhancements could include:

- [ ] Creating a consistent logging strategy across all components
- [ ] Adding structured logging with proper correlation IDs
- [ ] Implementing different log levels for development vs. production
- [ ] Adding performance metrics logging

Create a dedicated abstraction layer between OpenAPI and MCP:

- [ ] Separate OpenAPI parsing from MCP tool/resource generation
- [ ] Create clear interfaces between these responsibilities
- [ ] This would make it easier to adapt to future changes in either API

## Logging Strategy Refinement

Current logging seems spread across multiple components:

- [ ] Consider implementing a more structured logging strategy
- [ ] Centralize log configuration and log level management
- [ ] Make logging more consistent across components

## Testing Infrastructure Improvements

While tests appear comprehensive, there could be opportunities to:

- [ ] Create more shared test fixtures and utilities
- [ ] Implement more integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- [ ] Add property-based testing for schema transformations

## Error Handling Strategy

Implement a more consistent error handling approach:

- [ ] Define standard error types for different failure scenarios
- [ ] Create a central error handling mechanism
- [ ] Improve error reporting for better diagnostics

## Configuration Management

Move toward a more unified configuration management approach:

- [ ] Centralize configuration options
- [ ] Create a typed configuration schema
- [ ] Add validation for configuration values

## OpenAPI Operations Factory

Consider creating a factory pattern for OpenAPI operations:

- [ ] Abstract the creation of different operation types
- [ ] Make it easier to add support for new operation patterns
- [ ] Improve testability by allowing operation mocking

## Documentation Generation

Add automatic documentation generation:

- [ ] Create a documentation generator that explains the transformation process
- [ ] Document compatibility with different OpenAPI versions
- [ ] Generate examples for common API patterns

## Path Templates Standardization

The path template handling could be standardized:

- [ ] Unify the approach to URI template handling
- [ ] Create a more robust template parsing system
- [ ] Add more validation for template parameters
